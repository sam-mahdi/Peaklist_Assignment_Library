# SPARKY Assignment Tools
This repository contains programs to validate chemical shift assignments (SAVUS), predict chemical shifts to assist in assigning peaks (SAPUS), and to generate peaklist files in the proper format (SAG) by calculating RMSD values between the experimental chemical shift values, and predicted chemical shift values from SPARTA+. The programs are designed to directly use SPARTA and SPARKY files (no modifications needed). **NMRSTAR V3 files may also be used**

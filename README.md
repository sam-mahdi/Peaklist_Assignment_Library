# SPARKY Assignment Tools
This repository contains programs to validate chemical shift assignments (SAVUS) and predict chemical shifts to assist in assigning peaks (SAPUS) by calculating RMSD values between the experimental chemical shift values, and predicted chemical shift values from SPARTA+ . The programs are designed to directly use SPARTA and SPARKY files (no modifications needed). To use SAPUS, the peaklists must be in a particular format. This format can be generated by using SAG for sections of your protein, or SAVUS for the entire protein. Additionally, you may convert the SPARKY peaklist files into a NMRSTAR V3 file using SPARKYs Universal Format plug in. SAVUS does not check for errors in the peaklist for SPARKY converted NMRSTAR files. To confirm proper assignment, use SAC on these files.   **NMRSTAR V2,V3 and SPARKY Converted NMRSTAR V3 files may also be used (Use SAVUS to convert to proper format)**

# Peaklist Assignment Library (PAL)
This repository contains programs to validate chemical shift assignments (AVS) and predict chemical shifts to assist in assigning peaks (APS) by calculating RMSD values between the experimental chemical shift values, and predicted chemical shift values from SPARTA+ . The programs are designed to directly use SPARTA and SPARKY files, or NMRSTAR V2 and V3 files (no modifications needed). To use APS, the peaklists must be in a particular format. This format can be generated by using AG for sections of your protein, or AVS for the entire protein. Additionally, you may convert the SPARKY peaklist files into a NMRSTAR V3 file using SPARKYs Universal Format plug in. AVS does not check for errors in the peaklist for SPARKY converted NMRSTAR files. To confirm proper assignment, use SAC on these files.

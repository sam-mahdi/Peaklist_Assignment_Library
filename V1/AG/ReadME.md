Assignment generator (AG) is a program that generates properly formatted peaklist files for APS. 
While AVS compiles peaklists for the entire protein, AG enables the generation of peaklist files for chunks/portions of your protein. 
You may make your own peaklist files as well (as long as they are properly formatted, check manual for proper formatting).

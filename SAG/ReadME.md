SPARKY assignment generator (SAG) is a program that generates properly formatted peaklist files for SAPUS. 
While SAVUS compiles peaklists for the entire protein, SAG enables the generation of peaklist files for chunks/portions of your protein. 
You may make your own peaklist files as well (as long as they are properly formatted, check manual for proper formatting).

This is APS Version 2

This program calculates the RMSD difference between experimental chemical shifts and SPARTA+/BMRB Values

This version the code is cleaned up a touch, and sorted in separate files to both remove repitition, and make the code easier to read. 

There are also new features:

1. AG from Version 1 has merged into APS. Now it is called 'File Generator'. 
2. The input format is more flexible
3. A CH3Shift Module is added for Methyl Groups

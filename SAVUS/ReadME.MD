SPARKY-Assignment-Verification-Using-Sparta (SAVUS) This program uses the NHSQC, HNCA, HNCACB, and HNCO peaklists to calculate RMSD values using the N,C,CA,CB,HN assigned chemical shifts (SPARKY format) with experimental N,C,CA,CB,HN chemical shifts calculated using SPARTA+. Values below an RMSD of 2-3 are generally considered "accurate" and "properly assigned". Disclaimer: SPARTA+ predicts chemical shift values from the crystal structure. Thus, solution structure variations from the crystal structure may cause high RMSD values. Therefore this is not an absolute verifier, just a tool to assist in assignments.

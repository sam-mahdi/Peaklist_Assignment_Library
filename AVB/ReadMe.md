Assignment validation using BMRB (AVB) is a program that uses the average chemical shift values from the BMRB to validate your assignments. Addiitionally the output files generated are formatted so as to work with APS. Thus, if your protein lacks a crystal structure, you may predict the chemical shift values using the BMRB values.
